# Data Engineer - Challenge
This is the Basic Challenge for Data Engineers. 

Lider.cl wants to create a new shiny section for videogames, in order to bring custom videogame information to our clients, our Analytics team needs a new report each day with several videogames information. This information will be use to create a lot of ML models & Data Sicence to give the best experience to our customers and make the best decision of which videogame buy.

For this Challenge we want you do a Job who give us the Data for the Analytics team, but with a few concerns:
- The Job must be an ETL code in Java or Scala.
- We needs the Data Model for the problem.
- And we want a Deployment for this code.

## ETL Job
The job must received the datasets & brings a few things:
- The top 10 best games for each console/company.
- The worst 10 games for each console/company.
- The top 10 best games for all consoles.
- The worst 10 games for all consoles.

The data is in the folder data/ in the root, the report can be exposed as anyway you want, but remember this is a ETL Job.


## Data Model
The Data Model must be in 3NF. 
Save the model in the DataModel folder in both formats (datamodel format & JPG/PNG ).
```
Use any tool, but please tell us the tool you choose & why.
```

## Deployment 

We want you give us the way to deploy your job and run in any environment, So please put the way to deploy very clearly.
And of course we need the code to see how you do this.


# Concerns
- You can create a new README for anything you want to tell us, please don't name README.md
- We want to see if you know how to code, so use the best & top practices of Software Engineering!.
- This is an ETL Job, so show us all you know about good practices to do ETL's.
- Save all the changes in a new branch with your name.


## Datasets
We use the data from TopGames provided by Metascore.
