# Data Engineer - Challenge
This is the Basic Challenger for Data Engineers.
For this Challenge we want you do the next things:
- A microservice in Java/Scala.
- A Data Model for the specific data.
- A Deployment in Kubernetes for your microservice.

## Microservice
The microservices must received the datasets & brings a few things:
- The top 10 best games for each console/company.
- The worst 10 games for each console/company.
- The top 10 best games for all consoles.
- The worst 10 games for all consoles.

## Data Model
The Data Model must be in 3FN. 
Save the model in the DataModel folder in both formats (datamodel format & JPG/PNG ).
```
Use any tool, but please tell us the tool you choose & why.
```

## Deployment for Kubernetes 

Save all the YAML's you think we must use to deploy & we will run in our own Minikube.

We use Skaffold for this step. 

If you want to know more about Skaffold project follow this link: https://skaffold.dev/




## Datasets
We use the data from TopGames provided by Metascore.
